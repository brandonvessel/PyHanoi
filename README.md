# PyHanoi
PyHanoi is a simple terminal-based Towers of Hanoi simulator.

It simulates the three stacks, disks, and the moving process using a recursive function.

## Requirements
It is compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3.

Required Packages: none (it only uses `time` and `os`)

## Usage
Python 2 `python Hanoi.py`

Python 3 `py Hanoi.py`

## Config
- CLEAR_SCREEN = True   <--  boolean that defines the way we display the data
- disk_num = 7          <--  number of disks to simulate
- disk_speed = 0.12     <--  time (seconds) to sleep between displays. set to 0 to print as fast as possible (not recommended)
